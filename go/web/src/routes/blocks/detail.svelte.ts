// Block detail panel state (block-workbench W3, read-only). When a hit in the
// /blocks list is picked (BlocksPage select(id)), the model lazy-loads the full
// block through the scope-gated getBlock (POST /api/manage {action:"get"}) and
// the panel renders content + metadata + an "open in graph" link. A not-found /
// not-visible block is surfaced as an error state (apiFetch rejects the 200
// {success:false} envelope as ApiError), never a crash. Plain $state class with
// an injectable api so vitest covers the flow without a DOM (pool.svelte
// pattern). Editing/delete/sensitivity are later waves (W4/W5/W6).
